* Why not use docker directly?

  Docker implementations of windows and mac have some issues for now (docker-for-mac & docker-for-win still somehow uses VMs, then runs docker inside it).
  
  Ex: On Mac: [websocket/proxy issue ](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1662), on Win10: docker needs multiple restarts before successfull start
